%%% Regression test: server with socket_backend => socket and
%%% server_send_batching => false must still be able to send packets.
%%% Before the fix, server init dropped socket_state to undefined in
%%% that mode and do_socket_send / send_packet_to_addr fell back to
%%% gen_udp:send/4, but on the socket backend #state.socket is an OTP
%%% socket handle, so all server-side sends failed silently.
